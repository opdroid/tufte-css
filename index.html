        <h3>Code for tool makers<h3>
           <ol>
             <li>Think of your users as being smarter than you</li>
             <li>Breaking your tool into a minimal number of orthogonal concepts is key</li>
             <li>A good tool should commoditize the toolmaker. An ideal tool should render the toolmaker as jobless.</li>
             <li>Much thought needs to go into the boundary between the tool and the user. I hesitate to use the word interface here even though its meaning is apt since it has a very specific meaning in computing. The boundary needs to be clearly demarcated and should be stable in the order of years if not decades. Specifically the boundary should survive complete reimplementations of the tool</li>
             <li>A tool that helps a person earn their paycheck should be learnable in a couple of weeks. Smaller less ambitious tools should use that as an upperbound and scale downwards from there to require an amount of learning in proportion to the value they add to the users life</li>
          </ol>
